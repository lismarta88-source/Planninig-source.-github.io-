# A2R-IM-10 — Investment Planning & Budgeting (Overview)

## What is A2R-IM-10?

A2R-IM-10 is the investment planning and approval process where you develop, plan, budget, and authorize investment projects before execution begins. This phase is critical for investment success because the decisions made here—project scope, budget accuracy, resource allocation, and execution model—directly influence execution efficiency, asset capitalization, and financial reporting.

During A2R-IM-10, your project transitions from an idea to an approved, fully planned investment ready for execution teams. Decisions made in this phase ripple through the entire project lifecycle and impact financial performance, compliance, and portfolio governance.

## What A2R-IM-10 covers

A2R-IM-10 encompasses three interconnected subprocesses:

### A2R-IM-10-10: Set-up Project & Manage Data

Establishes the project master record and defines its foundational attributes. You create the project in the portfolio management system, assign it to organizational buckets (division, function, site), establish the project structure, classify the investment type, and maintain reference data throughout the project lifecycle. This subprocess ensures every project is properly registered, classified, and structured for governance and reporting.

### A2R-IM-10-20: Plan and Forecast Investments

Develops the financial and operational plan for the investment. You enter budgets at progressive accuracy levels (rough estimates through detailed forecasts), define resource capacity requirements, establish milestone timelines, and prepare supporting documentation such as business cases and fact sheets. This subprocess ensures that planning data is complete, realistic, and ready for decision-making.

### A2R-IM-10-30: Approve Investments

Routes authorization requests through the appropriate approval hierarchy and captures investment decisions. Approvers review project scope, budgets, and business justification, then grant or decline authorization based on governance policies and investment criteria. Once approved, the project transitions to execution planning.

## Where A2R-IM-10 fits in the lifecycle

### FEL Stages and Stage Gates

A2R-IM-10 spans **FEL0 through FEL2** and aligns with **Stage Gates G0, G1, and G2**, which focus on business planning and scope definition:

- **FEL0 (Gate G0):** Project is identified; initial investment case is sketched
- **FEL1 (Gate G1):** Scope and basic budget are defined; project is formally registered in the portfolio
- **FEL2 (Gate G2):** Detailed planning is complete; prefunding is approved for execution preparation

At each gate, you provide more detailed planning data, and decision gates determine whether the project advances, is held, or is cancelled.

### Preparation for Execution (A2R-IM-20)

A2R-IM-10 prepares the project for the execution phase (A2R-IM-20) by ensuring:

- **Scope is frozen** — No major scope changes after approval without formal change control
- **Budget is detailed and realistic** — Finance and project teams have confidence in cost estimates
- **Organizational alignment is clear** — The project is assigned to the right function, cost center, and location
- **Approval authority has been obtained** — All required signatories have granted authorization
- **Execution model is decided** — How the project will be executed (internal, external, hybrid) is determined

Once FEL2 authorization is approved, the execution project is automatically created and execution teams take over detailed planning and implementation.

## Systems used in this phase

### PPM (Portfolio & Project Management)

The primary system for A2R-IM-10. PPM is where you create projects, enter planning data (budgets, forecasts, milestones, classification), upload supporting documents, and route authorization requests for approval. PPM maintains the master record for each investment throughout its lifecycle and serves as the single source of truth for portfolio planning.

### PS (Project System)

The PS project is automatically created after your main authorization request (FEL2/FEL3) is approved in PPM. Before approval, PS is not involved. After approval, detailed execution planning and cost collection shift to PS.

### CPM (Commercial Project Management)

CPM reads portfolio and project data from PPM in real time and provides dashboards for milestone tracking and project status visibility across the portfolio. When you update forecasts or milestones in PPM, those changes appear immediately in CPM reports without requiring manual data transfers.

### SAC (Analytics Cloud)

SAC pulls portfolio and investment data from PPM to provide executive dashboards and analytics. Your projects automatically feed into portfolio performance views that leadership and investment managers use for portfolio governance and decision-making.

## Key decisions made in A2R-IM-10

A2R-IM-10 involves several critical business decisions:

- **Project type selection** — Classification of the investment (maintenance, upgrade, new asset, strategic initiative, etc.) determines approval workflows, budget review intensity, and asset capitalization treatment
- **Scope definition and freeze** — Defining what the project will and will not include; premature scope changes during execution are expensive and disruptive
- **Budget accuracy progression** — Moving from rough estimates (FEL0) through detailed budgets (FEL2) with confidence increases for decision-making
- **Execution model** — Deciding whether execution will be led internally, outsourced, or managed through a hybrid approach; this affects resourcing, timeline, and cost
- **Resource and capacity planning** — Confirming that internal resources or external capacity is available; resource conflicts discovered in this phase are much cheaper to resolve than during execution
- **Organizational ownership** — Assigning the project to the correct division, function, and cost center for governance, reporting, and accountability
